## Javier Ortiz-Tudela

I am a Ramón y Cajal Researcher at the [Center for Mind, Brain and Behaviour (CIMCYC](https://cimcyc.ugr.es/), Universidad de Granada).

I obtained my PhD with Prof. Juan Lupiañez and Prof. Luis Jiménez in 2018. Afterwards, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with [Prof. Yee Lee Shing](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/69824239/005_Prof_-Yee-Lee-Shing) at the [LISCO lab](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/55770598/Research) at Goethe University (Frankfurt). In 2023, I was awarded a Junior Researcher grant from the Junta de Andalucía to independently develop my own line of research.

My main field is Cognitive Neuroscience with a focus on understanding cognition as a continuous stream of processes. I am currently interested in semantic congruency as a transversal manipulation across different cognitive processes. During these past few years, I have been working on predictive processing in relation to perception and episodic memory. My other interests (and therefore, most of my side projects), touch upon Attention, Perception, Memory and (Explainable) Artificial Intelligence.

I am always ready to talk about research and to discuss new (or old) ideas so if you want to get in touch, just drop me [an email](mailto:ortiztudela@psych.uni-frankfurt.de) or find me on BlueSkye [(@ortiztudela.bsky.social)](https://bsky.app/profile/ortiztudela.bsky.social).
