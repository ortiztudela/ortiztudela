# Week 4: Episode Outline

## Objectives
Throughout this week you will:

- Continue refining the content through additional reading.

- Seek guidance and feedback as needed.

## Key Ideas from Previous Sessions
- Always keep in mind who your target audience is while you tailor the content and format of your work.
- Focus on a narrow sub-topic within your main topic. Conveying a few ideas effectively is better than swampping the audience in information.
- Attribute different roles to group members is a great way to maximize efficiency
- The recording should **not** be a formal presentation of a paper
- Use the skeptical watchlist while researching (available on this book and on PRADO)

## Tasks
1. **Refine Content:**

   - Conduct further reading on your selected topic. This keeps coming back again and again. And it does so for a reason! Reading and researching is keep to inform your opinion.
   
   **IMPORTANT NOTE!!** Not everything that you find (every paper, study, podcast) needs to be included or unpacked in the episode. Sometimes, this extra bits of information allow you to structure the ideas and to enrich the overall narrative with a novel angle but this might be not directly apparent for the a

   - Choose a tone that fits the topic and your audience.

4. **Assign Roles:**
   - Determine who will speak in each part of the episode.
   - Assign specific sections to each group member for detailed preparation.

   - Reach out to your instructors or peers for feedback and support as needed.
