The overarching aim of these sessions is to gain in-depth knowledge about certain sub-topics in Cognitive Neuroscience which, due to time limitation, cannot be covered in detail in the big group sessions. The final outcome will be a group project in which you will create a podcast-like episode on a subtopic of your chosing within Cognitive Neuroscience.",

    "text": "In-depth Research\n\nGetting Started\nWe gave you an initial paper for each one of the topics. Now it is time to review the one for your topic so that you can pull out some ideas and some more refereces that can guide you deeper into a concrete direction. Here are a few questions that might help you extract the relevant information from the paper:\n\nWhat’s the main focus of the article?\nWhich sections interest you most?\nDo you need additional context to understand certain parts?\nWhat other studies inspired the authors?\n\n\n\nFinding Additional Resources\nWhen conducting online scientific literature searches, you have several options, each with its own trade-offs between search time and output validation time.\n\nTraditional Databases\n\nPlatforms like Scopus and PubMed offer comprehensive, curated collections of scientific literature.\nThese databases typically require more search time but provide highly reliable, peer-reviewed results.\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\nA popular middle-ground option that balances search speed and result breadth.\nIt offers a user-friendly interface and wide coverage across various disciplines.\nWhile faster than traditional databases, it may include some non-peer-reviewed content.\n\nAI-Powered Tools\n\nEmerging platforms like Consensus use artificial intelligence to streamline the search process.\nThese tools significantly reduce search time but may require additional effort to validate outputs.\n\n\nValidation of search results is crucial, especially when using faster, more inclusive search methods. Google Scholar may include non-peer-reviewed materials, preprints, or even non-academic sources, which can affect the reliability of your research if not properly vetted. AI-powered tools, while efficient, may occasionally “hallucinate” or generate inaccurate information, particularly when dealing with specific data points or less common topics. These tools might also misinterpret context or nuance in complex scientific discussions. Therefore, it’s essential to cross-reference findings, verify sources, and critically evaluate the relevance and accuracy of search results, regardless of the platform used.\n\n\n\nSchematic depiction of the trade off between search time and validation time\n\n\nWhen choosing a search method, consider your research needs:\n\nFor thorough, highly validated results, traditional databases may be preferable.\nFor quick, broad searches, Google Scholar offers a good balance.\nFor rapid literature reviews or initial explorations, AI-powered tools can be valuable, but exercise caution and verify findings.\n\nRemember, the faster the search process, the more time you might need to spend validating the results. Choose the approach that best fits your research goals and time constraints, and always maintain a critical eye when reviewing your findings.\n\n\nAccessing papers:\n\nUse university network or VPN for paywalled journals\nTry different versions if available\nReach out to us if you can’t access a paper\n\n\n\nAlternative Research Methods\nExplore other platforms for ideas as well as for information:\n\nYouTube channels (e.g., kurzgesagt, AsapSCIENCE, WIRED)\nPodcasts (e.g., Brain Inspired, StarTalk, Lex Fridman Podcast)\n\nRemember to use your skeptical watchlist when exploring these sources!",

    "section": "Defining Your Podcast Audience",
    "text": "Defining Your Podcast Audience\nWhen creating a science-based podcast (or any kind of podcast, tbh), one of the most crucial decisions you’ll make is choosing your target audience. This choice should be made early in the planning process, as it will significantly influence various aspects of your podcast, including content, format, tone, and language.\n\nWhy Audience Matters\n\nContent Depth: The level of detail and complexity in your discussions will vary greatly depending on whether you’re addressing neuroscience specialists or the general public.\nLanguage Use: Technical jargon appropriate for scientists might confuse a lay audience, while oversimplification could bore experts.\nTopic Selection: Your audience’s background knowledge and interests will guide which topics are most relevant and engaging.\nFormat and Style: The podcast’s structure, length of the sections, and presentation style should cater to your audience’s preferences and listening habits.\n\n\n\nPotential Target Audiences\nConsider these example audience categories to aid your definition of your podcast’s focus:\n\nSpecialist Neuroscientists:\n\nHighly technical content\nIn-depth discussions of current research\nUse of field-specific terminology\n\nGeneral Scientists:\n\nBroader scientific context\nInterdisciplinary connections\nLess neuroscience-specific jargon\n\nPsychologists without Scientific Background:\n\nFocus on practical applications\nSimplified explanations of neuroscientific concepts\nConnections to psychological theories and practices\n\nGeneral Population:\n\nEmphasis on relatable examples and real-world implications\nClear, jargon-free explanations\nMore time spent on foundational concepts\n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive and other types of audiences can be considered. But bear in mind that by clearly defining your target audience in advance, you can create a more focused, engaging, and effective product. This clarity will guide your content creation process and help you build an engaging episode.",

    "text": "Types of Podcast Scripts\nThere are three main types of podcast scripts:\n\nFully scripted: Everything you intend to say is planned out. This makes recording and editing easier but can sound less spontaneous unless you bring a bit of acting to it.\nBullet script: More suitable for conversational podcasts. It allows for a natural flow while keeping the discussion on track.\nTalking points: The least structured approach. You only have main points, allowing the conversation to develop naturally.\n\nChoose the type that best fits the style of your group members and the content that you chose.",

For instance, your group could do the following:\n\nPerson X writes the initial draft\nPerson Y edits the first draft\nPerson Z takes the draft and the edits and create a polished version\n\nAnother valid option is to do cross-section editing:\n\nPerson X writes section 1\nPerson Y writes section 2\nPerson X edits section 2\nPerson Y edits section 1\nPerson X and Y incorporate edits of their sections\n\nThe writer should consider who will read the script and use language that the speaker is comfortable with.",

    "text": "Content Tips\n\n1. Engaging Introduction\nStart with a captivating introduction to hook your listeners. Consider:\n\nA thought-provoking question\nA brief anecdote\nA teaser about the episode’s topic\n\n\n\n2. Clear and Concise Language\n\nUse clear, concise language. It is counterproductive to include complicated terms when they are not needed.\nAvoid jargon or overly technical terms. Think that this is not a written work so the audience should (ideally) not have to go back to re-listen some parts to understand them.\nExplain complex concepts in an simple way. This is 80% of your job as a communicatior!\n\n\n\n3. Engage the Audience\n\nAsk questions\nShare relatable stories\nUse examples and references the audience might know\n\n\n\n4. Take-home Message\nIn some cases, it might be a good idea to end with the key ideas you want listeners to retain. This is particularly true if you have a long(er) podcast &gt;7-8 minutes and/or if you have includeded several ideas and you have not talked about the first ones during the second half of the show. Think very strategically: does re-taking an idea already discussed benefit the overall message? For rather short communications, there is no obligation to include a recap of everything discussed, so only include it if it adds something. Can you summarise your ideas into a one-liner? Do you want to open more related questions to hint at distant connections?\n\n\n5. Continuous Research\nDon’t hesitate to do more research as you write. This is a good thing! New questions may arise, requiring further investigation.",
