Each week focuses on specific tasks and milestones, building towards your final product. The workload is distributed between in-person sessions and autonomous group work.\n\nDuring the in-person sessions we will explain each step in the process and present you with strategies and tools so that you can work efficiently. In addition, some of the in-person time will be dedicated for group work so that you can complement your autonomous work. If you regularly attend the in-person sessions and you deliver all the milestones in their due time, the amount of autonomous work should be minimal.\n\n### Let's start at the end (product): Your own CogNeuro Podcast!\nThe main project of this course is to create a 5 to 10-minute podcast-like recording on a subtopic within Cognitive Neuroscience. Throughout the semester, you'll work through various milestones, from topic selection to the final production of your podcast episode. If you have never worked on a similar project, rest assure, we will walk you through all the steps so that, if you follow along, you will be able to complete the assignment in time.\n\nWe will give you a set of broad topics for you to choose from but you will also be able (and encouraged!) to work on a different topic that you find more interesting.

Each prize will add a 0.2 bonus to your whichever mark your podcast got according to the evaluation criteria (up to a maximum of 7 points).\n\n## Topics\n\nWe have selected one research paper as a starting point for each topic. You will find these papers below and also on PRADO. The main topics include:\n\n- **Neuroanatomy and plasticity**: [@merabet2010neural]\n- **Consciousness**: [@sohn2019decoding]\n- **Brain stimulation**: [@yavari2018basic]\n- **Poverty**: [@farah2017neuroscience]\n- **Neurosexism**: [@meynell2013delusions]\n- **Stereotypes and prejudices**: [@amodio2014neuroscience]\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn the coming weeks, you will dive deeper into one of these topics. You will learn about the parts that you find more interesting and attempt at integrating them together with your work group. The ultimate goal is that you can efficiently communicate all that information to the rest of your classmates. As a bonus, you will also get to learn from their work on the things that they find fascinating! Be prepared to engage in collaborative work, conduct in-depth research, develop your science communication skills, and learn to provide (and to receive) constructive feedback.\n\n### References\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n## Course Structure\nThe course is structured week-by-week, guiding you through the process of creating your podcast.
