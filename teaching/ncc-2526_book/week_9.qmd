# Week 9: Editing

## Quick Recap

At this stage, you should have an initial draft of your script and either have received or are about to receive feedback on it.

## The Editing Process

The general flow for creating your podcast episode should follow this pattern:

Idea -> Reading -> Outline -> Reading -> Writing (first draft) -> Feedback -> Polish script -> Recording -> Editing

Editing might require you to re-record some bits. This is normal. The listener will not know when certain sentences where recorded. Do use that opportunity to your advantage!

### Equipment:
- Computer
- Headphones
- Time, patience, and creativity!

### Software:
- If you're familiar with an audio editing program, use it!
- Audacity is a popular choice
- For more advanced editing, consider Descript (https://www.descript.com/) or Hindenburg Journalist (https://hindenburg.com/academy/trial/)

## Tips for Quality Recording and Editing

1. **Focus on content**: Audio is a coarse format, so content is key!
2. **Enhance your recording**: Consider adding background music, sound effects, or transitions
3. **Avoid common pitfalls**:
   - Eliminate background noises
   - Use a microphone that doesn't introduce buzzing
   - If multiple people are speaking, avoid talking over each other
4. **Listen and judge**: Always review your recording to ensure you're satisfied with the result

## Final Remarks

Remember that content is what is central. The format (music, transitions, edits) is just a nice envelope but one that will have a direct impact on how your audience takes in the message. Thus, it is a very important aspect that, if done poorly, can ruin the entire experience before it even begins.

## Next Steps
The next couple of weeks will be devoted to recording! Do spend time crafting the recordings and polishing them during post-production. Good luck with your edits, and remember to enjoy the process!
