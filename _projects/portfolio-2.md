One of the assumptions of predictive processing accounts is that high-order representations, and/or structures, send information downwards (i.e., feedback signals) to lower levels on the processing hierarchy. However, the nature of those high-order representations is still unknown. 

In this project we point at memory traces as a candidate source of predictions. Using fMRI and functional retinotopy we aim at relating stored memory representations to feedback signals in the early visual cortex. Moreover, using high field fMRI we are tracing the feedback signals from episodic memories down to the layer level.
