Real-world regularities get carved in our brains into what we call semantic information. This type of information is represented in a wide range of areas across the entire brain and, as a consequence, it is very likely to impact several cognitive processes. 

Tracing specific semantically-loaded stimuli across different cognitive processes will give us new insights into the computations that underlie them. In this project we are combining behavioral data with eye movements recordings to study:

- Scene and object conscious perception
- Object identification
- Episodic memory formation
