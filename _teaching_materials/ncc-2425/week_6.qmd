# Week 6: Script Writing

## Quick Recap

At this stage, you should have an outline for your episode, which should guide more specific reading and interviewing. Remember, the deadline for Milestone 3 (Script draft) is still a few weeks from now but it is a good idea to already start working on it.

## The Writing Process

The general flow of creating your podcast episode should follow this pattern:

Idea -> Reading -> Outline -> Reading -> Writing (first draft)

Before diving into the script, ensure you have:

1. A concrete a manageable topic
1. A detailed outline of the episode
1. A target audience
1. A tone for your podcast

## Types of Podcast Scripts

There are three main types of podcast scripts:

1. **Fully scripted**: Everything you intend to say is planned out. This makes recording and editing easier but can sound less spontaneous unless you bring a bit of acting to it.
2. **Bullet script**: More suitable for conversational podcasts. It allows for a natural flow while keeping the discussion on track.
3. **Talking points**: The least structured approach. You only have main points, allowing the conversation to develop naturally.

Choose the type that best fits the style of your group members and the content that you chose.

## Who Should Write the Script?

As with lit. search, distributing roles here can also be very effective. For instance, your group could do the following:

- Person X writes the initial draft
- Person Y edits the first draft
- Person Z takes the draft and the edits and create a polished version

Another valid option is to do cross-section editing:

- Person X writes section 1
- Person Y writes section 2
- Person X edits section 2
- Person Y edits section 1
- Person X and Y incorporate edits of their sections

The writer should consider who will read the script and use language that the speaker is comfortable with.

## Content Tips

### 1. Engaging Introduction
Start with a captivating introduction to hook your listeners. Consider:

- A thought-provoking question
- A brief anecdote
- A teaser about the episode's topic

### 2. Clear and Concise Language
- Use clear, concise language. It is counterproductive to include complicated terms when they are not needed.
- Avoid jargon or overly technical terms. Think that this is not a written work so the audience should (ideally) not have to go back to re-listen some parts to understand them.
- Explain complex concepts in an simple way. This is 80% of your job as a communicatior! 

### 3. Engage the Audience
- Ask questions
- Share relatable stories
- Use examples and references the audience might know

### 4. Take-home Message
In some cases, it might be a good idea to end with the key ideas you want listeners to retain. This is particularly true if you have a long(er) podcast >7-8 minutes and/or if you have includeded several ideas and you have not talked about the first ones during the second half of the show. Think very strategically: does re-taking an idea already discussed benefit the overall message? For rather short communications, there is no obligation to include a recap of everything discussed, so only include it if it _adds something_. Can you summarise your ideas into a one-liner? Do you want to open more related questions to hint at distant connections?

### 5. Continuous Research
Don't hesitate to do more research as you write. This is a good thing! New questions may arise, requiring further investigation.

## Format Tips

1. **Format for easy reading**: 
   - Use a conversational tone
   - Write short sentences
   - Use bullet points or headings
   - Include cues for pauses, emphasis, and tone

2. **Practice reading aloud**: 
   - Identify awkward phrasing
   - Edit for clarity and flow
   - Remember that what works for silent reading might not work when read aloud

3. **Cite your sources**: 
   - Adds credibility
   - Helps listeners find more information
   - **IMPORTANT:** There's no need to cite APA style (i.e., Last Name, Name, Title, Journal, Number, Page) as this is not a written report. Citations must be conversational as the full references will be included in a separate document.

## Interview Tips

1. **Be concise**: Tailor questions to what you expect from the interview
2. **Focused questions**: Don't ask questions that cover the entire scope of the episode
3. **Balance**: Don't make the expert the center of the episode
4. **Avoid broad closing questions**: Don't ask the expert to summarize everything in one sentence

## General Tips

1. **Stay Adaptable**: Be open to feedback and willing to improve
2. **Evaluate and Iterate**: Assess what's working and make adjustments
3. **Quality over Quantity**: Sometimes less information, presented clearly, is more effective

## Next Steps

After completing your script draft:

1. Review it as a group
2. Practice reading it aloud
3. Make necessary revisions
4. Prepare for the recording phase

Remember, a good script is the foundation of a great podcast episode. Take your time, be thorough, and don't be afraid to revise and improve as you go along.
