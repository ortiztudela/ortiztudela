# Week 12: Podcast Presentations and Group Feedback (Part 1)
You've made it to the finish line â€“ great work! You've embarked on a CogNeuro journey to become podcast creators. Let's take a quick look back at what you've pulled off in this course. Along the way, hopefully, you have acquired a set of very valuable skills from lit. search to audio editting. But also, some less easy to notice skills such as synthesizing tons of information and simplifying it down to its core elements. Congratulations on all of this!

This week we will jointly listen to the recordings of all the groups. This excersice will help you learn about _what_ the others have done and _how_ they have done it. It is a great opportunity to get ideas and, more importantly, to learn more about other areas of Cognitive Neuroscience: the better of a job they have done, the more you will be able to learn!

We will encourage you to ask questions to the creators and to give them **constructive** feedback. You will also be on the other end of this feedback so, again, great opportunity to learn and to improve. After listening to each podcast you all will vote the podcast on different aspects (e.g., content, format) so that we can give the final prizes based on the opinions of your peers.

Fonally, we will gather feedback from  all students on the entire podcast project so that we can improve it for the following year.

Let's make this session lively and engaging. Your participation and feedback are crucial for the success of this activity!
